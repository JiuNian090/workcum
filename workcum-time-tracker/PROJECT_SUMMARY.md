### 2. Reporting
- Date range selection for reports
- Quick select for current week/month
- Total hours calculation
- Data table display
- Excel export functionality

### 3. Scheduling
- Weekly calendar view
- Add, edit, and delete scheduled tasks
- Visual representation of scheduled tasks
- Navigation between weeks

### 4. Data Management
- Export all data to JSON format
- Import data from JSON file
- Clear all data functionality
- Backup and restore capabilities

### 5. Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Bottom navigation for mobile devices
- Desktop-friendly layout

## Technologies Used
- React 18 with Hooks

## Development Process
1. Project setup with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS
2. Implementation of responsive layout with mobile-first approach
3. Development of core features (time entry, reporting, scheduling, data management)
4. Styling with Tailwind CSS and custom components
5. Testing and bug fixing
6. Creation of documentation and README

## Challenges and Solutions
1. **Responsive Navigation**: Implemented a mobile-first approach with bottom navigation for mobile devices and top navigation for desktop.
2. **Date Handling**: Used date-fns library for reliable date manipulation and formatting.
3. **Data Persistence**: Utilized localStorage for client-side data storage with proper error handling.
4. **Excel Export**: Integrated SheetJS library for reliable Excel file generation.
5. **Styling Issues**: Fixed CSS conflicts and optimized Tailwind classes for consistent design.

## Testing
- Created automated functional tests for core features
- Verified localStorage functionality
- Tested time entries and schedule management
- Validated data import/export functionality

## Deployment
The application can be deployed to any static hosting service:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Pages

## Future Improvements
1. Add user authentication for multi-user support
2. Implement cloud storage synchronization
3. Add more advanced reporting features
4. Include project categorization and tagging
5. Add reminder notifications
6. Implement data visualization charts

## Conclusion
The Time Tracker application successfully fulfills all the requirements with a clean, responsive design and intuitive user interface. The application is fully functional with all core features implemented and tested. The codebase is well-structured and maintainable, following modern React development practices.
